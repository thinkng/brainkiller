%%  1. Hitting target: Three riflemen A, B, and C take turns shooting at a target. 
% The first rifleman to hit the target gets 2002 dollars. 
% No 1 shoots first, B second, and C third, after which the cycle repeats again with A, 
% until one of the riflemen hits the target. 
% Each hits the target with probability 0.5. 
% What is rifleman A's expected winnings in dollars?
